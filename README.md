# using-external-api
This project demonstrates how to use unreliable and slow external API effectively. The project utilises external API to fetch movie names and prices for different cinemas. Users can then use the front end portal to select different movies and visualise different prices from various cinemas.


The application uses the following technologies:
- Backend: NodeJs with an ExpressJs server
- Frontend: ReactJs 
- Type Checking: Typescript

## Getting Started

Create a .env file in the server diorectory and add the following line,
accessToken=<Your x-access-token>


```bash
cd ./server
npm install
npm start
```

The server runs on port `5000`.

There are three routes:
```
- http://localhost:5000/              - homepage
- http://localhost:5000//api/movies   - accepts GET requests for retrieving all the movie names
- http://localhost:5000/api/movie     - accepts POST requests with cinema names as the keys and the movie id's as the values
                                          e.g. {
                                              "cinemaworld": "cw0080684",
                                              "filmworld": "fw0080684"
                                            }
```

- npm run build            - will generate generate .js from the .ts files for production use
- npm run build:watch      - will generate generate .js from the .ts files for production use and watch for changes
- npm run dev              - will run the dev server
- npm start            - will start the production server
```

### Client

```
- npm run build            - will run webpact to generate static content out of jsx
- npm test                 - will run all the tests

## Project Structure

### Overall Structure

1. The project is devided in to two main directories. 
2. The `server` directory contains the express server as well as all the helper classes.
3. The `client` directory contains the reactjs Frontend code.

### Server Structure

1. The `server/test` directory contains all the unit and integration tests for the Backend server.
2. The `server/src` directory contains the route handler, the main app.ts and services.
3. The `server/data` directory contains the currency data in a json format.
4. The `server/config` directory contains all the site specific configs.
5. The `server/dist` directory contains all compiled js files.
6. The `server/public` directory contains all the static files generated by webpack build.

### Client Structure

1. The `client/src/App.tsx` directory contains the root react component for the Frontend.
2. The `client/src/SelectMovie.tsx` directory contains the functional component for generating the form.
3. The `client/src/PriceTable.tsx` directory contains the functional component for creating the price tables.
4. The `client/src/Errors.tsx` directory contains the functional component for displaying errors.

## Development
