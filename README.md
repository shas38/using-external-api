## Getting Started

```bash
cd ./server
npm install
npm start
```

The server runs on port `5000`.

There are three routes:
```
- http://localhost:5000/                - homepage
- http://localhost:5000/api/currencies  - accepts GET requests for retrieving all the unique currencies
- http://localhost:5000/api/profits     - accepts POST requests with fromDate, toDate and a list of currencies as post data
                                          e.g. {fromDate: '20180507', fromDate: '20180507', currencySelected: ['BTC', 'ETC']}
```

## Scripts

### Server

```
- npm run eslint           - will run the linter checks
- npm test                 - will run all the tests
- npm run coverage         - will generate code coverage reports
- npm run build            - will generate generate .js from the .ts files for production use
- npm run build:watch      - will generate generate .js from the .ts files for production use and watch for changes
- npm run dev              - will run the dev server
- npm start            - will start the production server
```

### Client

```
- npm run build            - will run webpact to generate static content out of jsx
- npm test                 - will run all the tests
- npm run eject            - will give access to all config files
- npm start                - will start the dev server
```

## Project Structure

### Overall Structure

1. The project is devided in to two main directories. 
2. The `server` directory contains the express server as well as all the helper classes.
3. The `client` directory contains the reactjs Frontend code.

### Server Structure

1. The `server/test` directory contains all the unit and integration tests for the Backend server.
2. The `server/src` directory contains the route handler, the main app.ts and services.
3. The `server/data` directory contains the currency data in a json format.
4. The `server/config` directory contains all the site specific configs.
5. The `server/dist` directory contains all compiled js files.
6. The `server/public` directory contains all the static files generated by webpack build.

### Client Structure

1. The `client/src/App.tsx` directory contains the root react component for the Frontend.
2. The `server/src/dateForm.tsx` directory contains the functional component for generating the form.
3. The `server/src/profitTable.tsx` directory contains the functional component for creating the profit tables.

## Development

This project uses EditorConfig to standardize text editor configuration.
Visit http://editorconfig.org for details.

This project uses ESLint to detect suspicious code in JavaScript files.
Visit http://eslint.org for details.

### Testing

This project uses Mocha, Chai and supertest for testing.
Visit http://mochajs.org, http://chaijs.com and https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest for details.

To execute tests:

```bash
npm test
```

Code coverage generated by http://istanbul.js.org

To calculate coverage:

```bash
npm run coverage
```

The coverage reports will be in the `coverage` folder

### Dev Server

To run the development express server and start `nodemon`:
